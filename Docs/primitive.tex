\section{\CCCFull{}}
In this section, we present the \CCCFull{} (\CCC{}) primitive, which aims to solve basic agreement 
problem between two \RSM{s}.
Every instance of \CCC{} has a {\em source} \RSM{} and a {\em destination} \RSM{}.
In each instance of \CCC{}, a designated {\em sender} replica at the source \RSM{} 
broadcasts a message $m$ to replicas at the destination \RSM{} ({\em receivers}).
If the sender is honest, then every honest receiver delivers $m$.
If the sender is faulty, then the primitive ensures that every honest replica at the  
destination \RSM{} delivers the same message.

The following four properties characterize the \CCC{} primitive: 
{\em validity} is a liveness property, whereas 
{\em no duplication}, {\em integrity}, and {\em consistency} are safety properties.

\begin{description}
\item[\bf Validity.]
If an honest sender sends a message $m$, then eventually an honest receiver delivers $m$.

\item[\bf No duplication.] 
No message is delivered more than once.

\item[\bf Integrity.]
If an honest replica at the destination \RSM{} delivers a message $m$ from a sender 
and sender is honest, 
then $m$ was sent by the sender and committed at the source \RSM{}.

\item[\bf Consistency.]
If one honest replica at the destination \RSM{} delivers a message $m$ and another 
honest replica at the destination \RSM{} delivers a message $m'$, then $m = m'$. 
\end{description}

Existing literature includes several protocols that implement \CCC{} primitive. 
However, these protocols either yield low throughput or require some trusted entity 
that cannot be compromised.
Our novel \Scrooge{} protocol is devoid of these challenges, and 
in the upcoming sections, we illustrate how \Scrooge{} efficiently implements the \CCC{} primitive.
