\subsection{\CCCFull{}}
\label{ss:c3b}
The goal of the \CCCFull{} primitive (\CCC{}) is to enable efficient and reliable communication 
between a sender \RSM{} and a receiver \RSM{}. 
%\CCC{} problem defines the guarantees between a sender \RSM{} 
%and a receiver \RSM{}.
%
To do so, we first need to define two new communication primitives that express exchanging messages between RSMs. These operations are thus at a coarser granularity than the traditional \textit{send} and \textit{receive} operations, which define the operations performed by a specific node or replica.
\begin{description}
\item[\bf Transmit.]
If a correct replica invokes C3B from $\SMR{s}$ to $\SMR{r}$ for message $m$, 
we say that \RSM{} $\SMR{s}$ {\em transmits} message $m$ to \RSM{} $\SMR{r}$.
\item[\bf Deliver.]
If a correct replica from $\SMR{r}$ receives message $m$, we say that \RSM{} $\SMR{r}$ {\em delivers} message $m$ from $\SMR{s}$.
\end{description}

Using these new communication primitives, we can then define the two correctness properties that all \CCC{} implementations must satisfy:
\begin{description}
\item[\bf Eventual Delivery.]
If \RSM{} $\SMR{s}$ transmits message $m$ to \RSM{} $\SMR{r}$, then $\SMR{r}$ will eventually deliver $m$.
%\nc{I don't follow, what does it mean for an RSM to be honest? Shouldn't we enforce validity regardless of whether the link is reliable?}
\item[\bf Integrity.]
For every message $m$, an \RSM{} $\SMR{r}$ delivers $m$ at most once from $\SMR{s}$ and only if $\SMR{s}$
transmitted $m$ to $\SMR{r}$.
\end{description}

%In the next section, we introduce \Scrooge{}, a practical and efficient protocol that implements \CCC{}.
