\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf \em Security Concerns}
Vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridges have been the target of numerous prominent security incidents, with billions of dollars in assets stolen in 2022 by August. \cite{2billion} 
In October, 570 million dollars of the Binance coin were stolen in a single such attack.\cite{binance}
These attacks affect both trust-based and trustless systems, and while mitigation strategies have been explored \cite{xscope}, the underlying issues persist.
