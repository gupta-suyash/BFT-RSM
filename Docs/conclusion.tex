\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduced the \CCC{} primitive and proposed \Scrooge{}, an efficient implementation of \CCC{}. We show that, by borrowing techniques from TCP and adapting these to the crash and BFT context, we can develop a solution that allows RSMs to efficiently exchange messages.
